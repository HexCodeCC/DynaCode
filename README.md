# DynaCode

### What's this?

This is DynaCode's develop branch. All files in here are under development and downloading builds from this branch is not recommended as most of the time they won't work correctly, if at all.

### Install
DynaCode is not finished yet, but you *can* use it. To do so simply download the **build/DynaCode.lua** and save it in your ComputerCraft computer. When fully released a pastebin installer will be available.

Once the **DynaCode.lua** file is inside of your computer, simply use this line of code at the start of your file:

```lua
dofile("path/to/DynaCode.lua")
```
Then all DynaCode classes will be available, you can also define your own classes after running `dofile`.
